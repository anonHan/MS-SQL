--49. Customer grouping - fix null
--There's a bug with the answer for the previous question.
--The CustomerGroup value for one of the rows is null.
--Fix the SQL so that there are no nulls in the
--CustomerGroup field.


-- There were no NULL values in the above table in my case. And this could be because I am using a slightly different database from the another year.
